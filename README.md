# RLDDM
This repository contains code used to estimate a combined Q-learning - drift diffusion model of probabilistic reinforcement learning.

The model is described in Lund Pedersen M., Frank, M.J., Biele, G. (in press) The drift diffusion model as the choice rule in reinforcement learning. *Psychonomic Bulletin & Review*.

The model is implemented in R, using Jags, and the Rwiener package.
