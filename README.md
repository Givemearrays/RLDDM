# RLDDM
This repository contains code used to estimate a combined Q-learning - drift diffusion model of probabilistic reinforcement learning.

The model is implemented in R, using Jags, and the Rwiener package. A full description of the model can be found in: 
Lund Pedersen M., Frank, M.J., Biele, G. (in press) The drift diffusion model as the choice rule in reinforcement learning. *Psychonomic Bulletin & Review*.
